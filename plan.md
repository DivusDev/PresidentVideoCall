### Plan

#### Idea 
Create a livehosting site for the president to interact with the people of america
The president would stream to the world once a week and everyone could tune into his stream
Anyone could ask whatever questions they wanted to and whichever questions get asked the most would get asked to the president
this would give the people a direct and unfiltered response to what they would like to know


#### Execution

* we need to create a react app that will be able to livestream
* people need to be able to log in and * tune into whoever is livestreamings live stream
* there needs to be a chatting interface in place
* we need to choose the best question out of all the questions given
  * Maybe this can be solved with ?ML?
